# Where's the code?
I'm currently working in v2.0, so the code will be available at [Yout Repo](https://github.com/youtplayer/yout) when I release it. But, it's an Electron app, you have the code when you download Yout, ok?

# Yout has started getting commercials

I'm sorry about that. It will be fixed in v2.0 release.
